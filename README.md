A very simple drag and drop Heatmap for anything 2D in Unreal engine.
This heatmap plugin allows you to export the heatmaps as images, import them easily back into the game and gives the choice between a Top-Down view and a Side view.
Additionally, as many actors as needed can be added for the heatmap to trace, by default it takes the player character to trace.

# Imports and Exports
You can find the Exports inside of the Exports folder in the Plugin/Content folder.
To import images, make sure the Heatmaps you want to import are placed inside of the Imports folder, located in Plugins/Content.
For the importing to work, the name of the image needs to be the same as the Heatmap placed inside your level, so it will be applied to the correct one.
